# The Logos Protocol — Mission Directive (living charter)
**Purpose**  
The Logos Protocol ensures that as new data is ingested and analyzed, emergent intelligences (tags, motifs, correlations, insights) are folded back into the system to guide future ingestion, analysis, and expression.
**Core Loop**  
Ingest → Parse → Index → Tag → Analyze → Insight → Logos/Knowledge → (guides next loop)
**Design Pillars**  
- Modularity & Replaceability
- Human-inspectable artifacts (logs, jsonl, md)
- Versioned, snapshot-able states
- Fail-safe, resilient runs
- Sacred efficiency (fast, simple operators; rich internals)
**Artifacts**  
- /parsed  → human-readable text
- /jsonl   → machine records (v2, v3…)
- /logs    → truth trail
- /logos   → knowledge (stats, correlations, doctrine.md)
- /insights→ insight entries (insights.jsonl)
**Self-Expansion**  
- Tag rules (tags.json) drive first-order signals
- Analyses surface co-occurrence & trend deltas
- Insights (human+machine authored) get persisted & feed the next run
- Knowledge is versioned snapshots with metrics & recommendations
