# Pro Sprint Roadmap — Logos Pipeline
> Goal: Use a short window of ChatGPT Pro to supercharge Logos.  
> All outputs saved to disk + committed so pipeline is self-contained after Pro ends.
---
## 1. Tag Expansion & Quality
- [ ] **Bulk Pattern Mining:** Feed Pro your entire `parsed/` corpus and ask it to propose new regex patterns for recurring motifs (beings, light, gamma oscillations, cross-cultural elements).
- [ ] **Auto-merge:** Save suggestions into `logos/tags_additions.json` and run `Update-Tags` + `Logos-RunAll`.
- [ ] **Gap Analysis:** Have Pro highlight untagged but common terms.
## 2. Tag Clustering & Doctrine Seeds
- [ ] **Cluster Analysis:** Give Pro the co-occurrence table (`Top-Cooccurrences`) and ask it to cluster tags into proto-themes.
- [ ] **Doctrine Drafts:** Save the resulting themes into `logos/doctrine_drafts/` as Markdown for future editing.
- [ ] **Archetype Map:** Have Pro suggest archetypal groupings (Light, Void, Peace, Review, Future glimpses, etc.) linked to tag clusters.
## 3. Insight Mining
- [ ] **Paradox Extraction:** Ask Pro to scan for veridical perception, cross-cultural anomalies, children’s NDEs, and create `insights/insights.jsonl` entries.
- [ ] **Timeline Events:** Have Pro extract any dates / future knowledge claims into a structured file.
## 4. Enhanced Reports
- [ ] **Deep Report:** Use `Generate-Report` but with Pro generating richer commentary sections below the tables.
- [ ] **Comparative Reports:** Run `Compute-TagDiff` across snapshots and have Pro narrate the trends; save to `logos/reports/trends_*.md`.
## 5. Code Improvements
- [ ] **Function Audit:** Ask Pro to review `bin/science3.ps1` for:
  - error handling
  - parameter defaults
  - performance improvements
  - adding unit tests (PowerShell Pester)
- [ ] **CLI Wrappers:** Optional — create small `bin/run.ps1` wrappers for one-command execution (no manual dot-sourcing).
## 6. Documentation & Onboarding
- [ ] **Architecture Diagram:** Pro draws a high-level diagram (PNG or ASCII) of pipeline flow: raw → parsed → JSONL → tagging → knowledge → doctrine/report.
- [ ] **Quickstart & FAQ:** Generate polished `README.md` with screenshots, examples, and CLI snippets.
- [ ] **Contribution Guide:** Optional — `CONTRIBUTING.md` explaining how to add new tag patterns, run pipeline, commit snapshots.

### Workflow Tips
- Before each major Pro-assisted step: `Save-KnowledgeSnapshot` to preserve baseline.
- After Pro produces new outputs: `git add` + `git commit -m "Pro Sprint: [task]"`.
- After sprint ends, you’re left with:
  - Enriched `tags.json`
  - New `insights.jsonl` entries
  - Doctrine drafts & reports
  - Updated README and helpers
  - All code changes tracked in Git

**End of Plan**
