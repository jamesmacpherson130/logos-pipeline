# Logos Protocol (Trigger)
- Keyword **logos** = apply protocol automatically:
  1) If a command is appropriate: run `Logos-RunAll` with the best-known tags/params, refresh doctrine/report.
  2) If a decision is needed: use current `logos/doctrine.md`, tag stats, and recent insights to propose next actions.
  3) Prefer auto-generated patches and scripts; show exactly what to paste/run when needed.
This is a convention; it does not require Pro to operate.
